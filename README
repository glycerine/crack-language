This is the the Crack Executor - it runs programs written in the Crack 
scripting language.

Crack is a language similar to C/C++/Java that compiles directly from a script 
to machine code.

We believe that the crack binaries and runtime libraries are not encumbered by 
the licensing terms of these files because in all cases either:
  1) they are not source code for crack generated binaries or
  2) They are released under a more permissive license than the MPL 2.0

If you believe that we are in error and that the 
licensing terms of one or more of these files does limit the permissions given 
by MPL 2.0, please contact mmuller@enduden.com.
